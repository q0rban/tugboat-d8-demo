# Pantheon Makefile template for Tugboat

# Please modify the following environment variables to match your project.
# The Pantheon site name where the database and files will be copied from. If
# you're unsure, you can run 'terminus site:list --fields=id,name'.
PANTHEON_SOURCE_SITE ?= example-pantheon-site
# The Pantheon environment to pull the database and files from. This is
# typically dev, test, or live.

# Specify the desired version of PHP in major.minor format, e.g. 7.1. For
# Pantheon sites, go to the dashboard of your site, click Settings, then click
# PHP Version.

# your Drupal /sites directory. This is typically just default unless you are
# using Drupal multisite.

# Specify the location of the directory that is the web root of the site,
# relative to the repo root, i.e. $TUGBOAT_ROOT. For example, if /web is where
# Drupal is installed, set DRUPAL_ROOT = ${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/web.
